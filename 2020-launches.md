+ as many as 8 Starlink/rideshare missions

(SARah 1 could launch in November, but more likely will be in 2021)

Takeaways:
SpaceX has already exceeded the 13 missions of 2019 and will likely (>80% confidence) beat the record of 21 missions set in 2018. About half of Falcon 9's manifest is Starlink launches.

2020 or 2021 will probably be the peak launch year for Falcon 9, as Starship will replace it for most missions by 2022. I expect at least half of the 12 Starlink lauches planned for 2021 will be carried by a Starship. There are currently 21 non-Starlink missions planned for 2021.

Falcon 9 will probably exceed the 135 missions flown by STS, but it may take until 2025. The missions currently planned for 2021 will leave it 9 missions shy of that. While the 12 missions planned for NSSL Phase 2 probably will be flown on a Falcon, I expect most commercial customers to switch to Starship by 2022. NASA might continue using Falcon until 2024. By then, it will definitely be a "legacy vehicle."

If Space Force is sufficiently impressed to switch NSSL flights to Starship before 2025, ULA will be in very serious trouble. They might renegotiate the contracts and give more launches to SpaceX.
